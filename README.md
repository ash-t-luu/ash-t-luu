👩‍💻 I’m currently working on React Labyrinth, a Visual Studio Code Extension.

🌱 I’m currently learning technologies like Next.js, RSC, and Docker. I have experience in JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, React.js, Node.js/Express.js, SQL/NoSQL databases, and much more!

⬇️ Below are some projects I've worked on. Let's connect if you have any questions!
